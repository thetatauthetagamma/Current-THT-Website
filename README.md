## Domain Information

1. The website is currently deployed at https://thetatau-umich.org/
2. Netlify has been used to link the personal Github of HariChidam to THT Organization for deployment. 

## Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1. Ensure Node.js (updated to the current version) is installed by checking `node -v`.
2. Check if npm (updated to the current version) is installed by checking `npm -v`.
3. Clone the repository onto the local machine: `git clone [url]`.
4. Navigate into the directory (`cd [directory_name]`) and install all dependencies via `npm install`.
5. Request an invitation to the Supabase Project from Hari/Kate.
6. Get the `.env` file (containing API keys) from Hari/Kate and place in the root directory. NOTE: This file is NOT on Github.
7. Launch the website locally using `npm run dev`. Verify setup by visiting http://localhost:3000/.

## Contribution Guidelines

Use the following process for making changes:

1. Check the current branch using `git branch`.
2. Keep branch up-to-date with `git pull`.
3. To implement changes, create a new branch using `git checkout -b [FEATURE_NAME]`.
4. Once changes are made:
    - Stage files with `git add [changed_files]`.
    - Create commit with `git commit -m "meaningful commit message"`.
    - Push changes to the remote repository with `git push --set-upstream origin [FEATURE_NAME]`.
5. If a branch is ready to be merged, open a Pull Request on Github.
6. Notify Kate for the merge approval.
7. Post-merge, the feature branch may be deleted. Repeat the process and generate a new branch for the next set of changes.

NOTE: Any changes merged to the main branch will be automatically built, cloned onto Hari's personal repo (via Github Actions), and deployed.

## Tech Stack Overview
- **Next.js** is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, making it ideal for building highly optimized and performant web applications. If you aren't familiar with React, React is a library for web and native interfaces that allows you to build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components, which can be community components or custom components. Next.js simplifies development by offering built-in routing, which means that any file in the pages directory will automatically become a page on the website. For example, if you make a committees.js page in the pages directory, this will automatically be accessible at thetatau-umich.org/committees. It also allows us to use both typescript and javascript, which you will notice we use a mix of throughout our code base.
- **Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to style their web applications directly in their HTML using predefined classes. It provides a highly customizable and efficient way to build responsive and consistent designs without writing custom CSS, making it popular for rapid development and maintaining design consistency across projects. Honestly it makes it so much easier to style the website and I think once you guys get used to it, you'll find it super useful. Just checkout any of the code, and look at where it says `className=''`. Any tailwind styling within this will be applied.
- **Supabase** is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) that provides real-time databases, authentication, and storage services, similar to Firebase but with a focus on using PostgreSQL as its core database. You can checkout examples of how we interact with Supabase in our code in the `auth.js` file. Make sure to import `supabase.js` in any file you want to use it. Supabase.js sets up the connection, using the key that you will have stored in the `.env` file.

  ## Supabase
  ### Tables
  1. **Big Little Pairings** : This table keeps track of the uniqnames of all big little pairings.  Foreign key relation: littleuserid->public.Brothers.userid and biguserid->public.Brothers.userid, which basically just means that the uniqname of the little and of the big have to be names that exist in the Brothers table. This means that the little cannot be added as their big until they have been initiated!!!!! So basically, each time a pledge class gets initiated, you have to add all of the big little pairings to this table (you can do that directly in supabase or just on the frontend if your adminRole is dev). Keeping these up to date is important because they are displayed on the fam tree.
  2. **BrotherProfiles**: This is where we used to save all brothers information. IT IS NO LONGER ACTIVE. There is info including where they are from, their email, etc. This table is not currently active within our code base, and you should use the "Brothers" table for current up to date info.
  3. **Brothers**: This is where we keep up to date info about brothers. The primary key is userid, which is their uniqname, and there is info including their pronouns, their major, their classes, their old classes, and more.
  4. **Committee Sign Offs**: This is where we track the current PC's committee sign offs. The columns need to be updated each semester with what the current PD Sign offs are, and they also need to be updated accordingly in `constants/pledgeConstants.js`. The key should be the column name in supabase, and the value should be what you want to be displayed when different committees are displayed.
  5.  **Emails**: This table keeps track of brothers' emails. It is outdated, and not used in the code base,
  6. **PD Sign Offs**: Similar to committee sign offs, this is where we track the current PC's PD Sign offs. The columns need to be updated each semester with what the current PD Sign offs are. Please also update `constants/pledgeConstants.js`
  7. **Pledges**: This is the equivalent of the brothers table, but for pledges. New pledges need to be added each semester. At the end of the semester, they need to be initiated. There is a button on the admin page to assign role numbers and initiate pledges. This will automatically remove all of their pledging data and move their profiles to the brothers table.
  8. **Rush Events** : This is where we store the semesters rush events so that they display on the rush page. Updating this is super important in case rushees are getting info from our website. Below is an example of what this can look like when rush is not currently taking place.
 
  ### admin Roles in Supabase
If you need to access any front end admin features, set your adminRole in the Brothers table to `dev`. This should give you access to anything you may need to do. Its basically so that you can test out the features that are developed for EBoard and if they get too lazy to do them, it is up to you to complete these responsibilities, which are outlined next.

Also, the following variables are used for different adminRoles throughout the code: 
`['regent', 'vice', 'scribe', 'treasurer', 'corsec', 'parents', 'academic'] or ['dev']`

## Action Required Each Semester
### Beginning of Each Semeseter
In `constants/pledgeConstants.js`:
- The PD Requirements need to be updated. Please see information in the [[#Tables]] under PD Requirements. 
- The Committee Sign Offs need to be updated. Please see information in the [[#Tables]] under Committee Sign Offs. 
- The deadline for pledge requirements needs to be updated with the date that requirements are due. This is because pledges see a countdown to the date that requirements are due. 
- There is a resources page under both brothers and pledges. This needs to be updated each semester with the correct links. Some links that should be included on the brothers page are
	- Attendance Form (Get this from Scribe)
	- Fraternity Feedback Form (Get this from Regent or any member of EBoard)
	- EBoard Feedback From (Get this from Regent or any member of EBoard)
	- Risk Manager Form (this isnt always a thing, but if it is ask Risk)
	- Pledge Feedback Form (Get this from pledge parents)
	- Reimbursement Form (Get this from Treasurer)
- Resources that should be included on the Pledge Resources Page:
	- Pledge Syllabus (Get from parents)
	- Pledge attendance (Get from Scribe)
	- Nationals Form (this link doesnt change)
	- Anything else the parents may want
- One more link that needs to be updated: Pledge feedback form on the brothers/pledgetracking page.


### End of Each Semester (AFTER Initiation)
- Update EBoard. You can do this by updating adminRoles in supabase, or on the front end,
- Initiate Pledges: Highly recommend doing this one on the front end because it will clear all of their data and properly add them to the brothers database.
- Archive Classes: All you have to do is click this button and all brother classes in the `classes` column will be moved to the `archivedclasses` column.
- Add Big Little parings to the `BigLittlePairings` table in supabase. This is how we display the big little pairings in the fam tree. You can get the pairings from the parents, and you wont be able to add them to the table until after initiation. We should add a front end feature to do this but it is currently not a feature.
